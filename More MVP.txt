THINKFUL FINAL
MVP Brainstorm - Second Round ("the knives sharpen")

Short list of user stories for your MVP
	As a user, I want to look up my Battle.net performance on Overwatch
	As a user, I want to look up my friends' Battle.net performance on Overwatch
	As a suer, I want to know I'm looking at the right account
	As a user, I want to be able to break down the score by hero

List of distinct screens
	Onboarding / Simple Search
		Name / Battletag (textarea/input)
		Platform (dropdown)
		Region (dropdown)
	Detail Page

Your user flows for each screen

Simple Search
	User submits a valid name / ID -> taken to a detail page
	User enters a name, but invalid -> thrown an error, suggest that string doesn't exist
	User enters a "valid" name but no result -> thrown an error, suggest they try another combination

DETAIL PAGE
	User clicks "hero" list (individual characters played by the individual user) -> win/loss ratio for that hero is displayed
	User clicks "all" -> win/loss ratio for ALL heroes for that player is displayed

Possible expansions:
	Historical win/loss timeline? Volumetrics?
	Icons for individual Heroes?
	Kill-to-Death ratio?

Concerns:
	This may be modelled very strongly after other simple webapps, but the final does imply full CRUD operations for a given API. It also overlooks the use of NoSQL databases used elsewhere in this course. Should this final app store individual users to retain their daily win/loss ratio?
